# Sync all the things

## Add all (and future) CSS events into your calendar
Add the following calendar into your preferred calendar software:

```
(Unfortunately, Google Calendar and Outlook don't update this calendar very quickly.\
If you have any doubt of when events are, check teams or [our social medias](https://cssbristol.co.uk#stay-in-the-loop).)
