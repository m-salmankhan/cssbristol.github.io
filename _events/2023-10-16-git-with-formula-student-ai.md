Dr David Bernhard will be delivering an introduction to git talk. Git is a crucial piece of software when working on collaborative codebases. This talk is open to all CSS members who would be interested in learning Git - there is no previous experience or knowledge required.

Formula Student AI will be using git extensively as part of this project, so it is very important that you understand its fundamentals if you are going to be involved.

We'll be in MVB 1.15PC, but if you'd rather call in, you can [join us on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3AiDcBRB0rhUTJVSmSIavEgiisw6-SC0Y-gP5m6YBoYo01%40thread.tacv2/1696588846504?context=%7B%22Tid%22%3A%22b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b%22%2C%22Oid%22%3A%22ca49d28a-4744-46ae-88b4-ac57436104b9%22%7D).
